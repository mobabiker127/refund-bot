# About Refund Bot

Refund Bot was originally created to help maintain moderation and structure in my personal Discord community — a server I co-owned from 2021 until 2022 with around 200 active members. The goal was to automate moderation tasks, streamline communication, and create a smoother, safer experience for everyone involved. Over time, it’s evolved into more than just a moderation tool — it’s become a reflection of what I’ve learned while managing and building online communities.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand Refund Bot beyond moderation. Future updates will include interactive features such as mini-games, community engagement tools, and other fun commands to make the bot more lively and social. My long-term goal is to polish and optimize the project so it can be publicly released, allowing other Discord servers to invite and benefit from Refund Bot as well.
